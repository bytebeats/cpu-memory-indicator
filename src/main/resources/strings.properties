max_attempts_before_unresponsive_log=Max attempts before unresponsive log
max_attempts_explain=(reduce to detect shorter freezes)
max_attempts_explain_tip=If the product is unresponsive for (max attempts) * (sampling interval in ms), dump threads every sampling interval in ms
max_attempts_tip=If the product is unresponsive for (max attempts) * (sampling interval in ms), dump threads every (sampling interval in ms)
provider_explain=(Provided by: Cpu & Memory Indicator plugin)
reset_to_default=Reset to default
attempt_interval_explain=(reduce to take dumps more frequently when the freeze is detected, limited by sampling interval)
attempt_interval_explain_tip=If the product is unresponsive for (max attempts) * (sampling interval in ms), dump threads every sampling interval in ms
attempt_interval_ms=Attempt interval in ms
attempt_interval_tip=Maximum time in ms for UI freezes. If UI thread freezes longer the thread dump will be logged
sampling_interval_explain=(reduce to detect even shorter freezes - at the cost of CPU time, requires restart)
